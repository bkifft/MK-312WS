No promises, but as I intend to send a few out I might as well offer it to everyone.
Just bear in mind that this isn't a commercial offer, but a by the community for the community kinda deal.
As such I don't have any stock and will build on request in my spare time only.
Also shipping is expensive as fuck. I will use your ready to print shipping label from Germany, if you want to cover the shipping fees on your own.

You can reach me on Discord bkifft#4189 or by e-mail pcb@bkifft.com.
