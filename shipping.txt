No promises, but as I intend to send a few out I might as well offer it to everyone.
Just bear in mind that this isn't a commercial offer, but a by the community for the community kinda deal.
As such I don't have any stock and will build on request in my spare time only.
Also shipping is expensive as fuck. 

Product cost:
Naked PCB: 1€
Poppulated PCB: 2€
Complete module: 10€

Shipping including tracking:
Germany: 7€ (insurance value 500€)
European Union: 8,50€ (insurance value 50€)
Rest of World: 14€ (insurance value 50€)
